drug resistance\nevolution: the interdependence of mutations that disrupt drug binding (usually also decreasing enzyme activity)\nand compensatory mutations that increase enzyme activity. Combinations of these types of mutations are\ntypically observed in pathogens that evolve clinically relevant resistance. The mechanisms that underlie these\nmutations have not been extensively investigated. Here, we plan to comprehensively analyze all combinations\nof mutations in Mpro from SARS-CoV-2 that disrupt binding to nirmatrelvir with those that increase enzyme\nactivity. Nirmatrelvir is the active component in Paxlovid that is currently an effective treatment for COVID19.\nWe developed a yeast screen for Mpro activity that is both safe because it does not create or use virus and\nbiologically relevant because it uses a cut-site that is used by the virus. Mutations we identified with this screen\nhave been observed in SARS-CoV-2 viruses selected for resistance, further indicating the screens biological\nrelevance. In the first aim of this work, we will quantify how all combinations of drug-binding and increased\nactivity mutations impact Mpro activity and drug disruption in our yeast screen. The resulting data will be\nanalyzed to elucidate patterns and their structural underpinnings. As compensatory mutations can be specific,\nin the second aim, we will perform an unbiased analysis of all possible point mutations in the background of\ntwo mutations that strongly disrupt nirmatrelvir binding. Together these aims will provide a new view of how\nmutational interdependencies impact the evolution of drug resistance in a clinically important pathogen.", "project_title": "Comprehensive analysis of epistasis in drug resistance potential of Mpro from SARS-CoV-2", "phr_text": "PROJECT NARRATIVE\nViruses and other human pathogens often find ways to evade the drugs that we use to treat them.

Veterans unable to\nhave treatment at VA Medical Centers in a timely fashion. However, the delivery of surgical care outside the\nVA poses barriers to care coordination for pain management during the transitions before and after surgery,\nleading to increased risk for chronic opioid use (COU). A multidisciplinary approach to perioperative pain\nmanagement known as the Transitional Pain Service (TPS) has been shown to effectively reduce COU among\nVeterans after orthopedic surgery, but it is unknown whether this approach can be delivered virtually to reduce\nCOU among at-risk Veterans undergoing similar procedures at non-VA hospitals.\nSignificance: Community Care referrals for orthopedic surgery are very common (>30,000 cases annually)\nand place Veterans at risk for COU. The proposed study represents a unique opportunity to evaluate a\ntelehealth TPS approach to address care coordination and reduce risks for COU among Veterans when they\ntransition between VA and non-VA surgical care.\nInnovation & Impact: No prior studies have evaluated the impact of a TPS approach to improve coordination\nof pain management for Veterans undergoing major surgery at non-VA hospitals. This project presents a\nunique opportunity to apply an evidence-based approach to help improve the coordination of pain management\nfor Veterans using Community Care for orthopedic surgery at non-VA hospitals and reduce the risk of opioid\nmisuse. Data from this study will be critical to support the broader dissemination of telehealth TPS across the\nnational VHA.\nSpecific Aims:\nAim 1. To evaluate a telehealth transitional pain service approach for preventing COU among Veterans\nreferred to non-VA hospitals for orthopedic surgery.\nAim 2. To identify barriers and facilitators of care coordination when Veterans undergo orthopedic surgery at\nnon-VA hospitals and use telehealth TPS.\nAim 3. To compare patient and payer costs with clinical outcomes among Veterans receiving telehealth\ntransitional pain service versus standard in-person follow-up visits for pain management.\nMethodology: In Aim 1, we will randomize Veterans referred to non-VA hospitals in VISN-19 for orthopedic\njoint procedures at two VAMCs to a TPS with regular follow-up telehealth visits after surgery versus only\nreceiving standard care for managing opioid tapering in the 90-days following hospital discharge. In Aim 2, we\nwill conduct interviews with VA providers and Veterans who used Community Care for orthopedic surgery to\nidentify factors that influence coordination of pain management. And in Aim 3, we will estimate patient and VA\nperspective costs when Veterans use Community Care and perform a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing\ntelehealth TPS to receiving only standard follow-up care with surgical and PCP teams for pain management.\nNext Steps/Implementation: The research findings from this study will be used to evaluate and refine the\ntelehealth TPS approach designed to improve coordination of pain management for at-risk Veterans\nundergoing orthopedic surgery at non-VA hospitals. Our study will help identify factors that influence\ncoordination of pain management among Veterans using Community Care and their VA providers, and\ndetermine whether a telehealth TPS approach is cost-effective to both patients and payers.

these variants lead to disease often remain unknown.\nCatel-Manzke syndrome (CMS) is a condition in which patients exhibit Pierre Robin Sequence (PRS),\nencompassing micrognathia and cleft secondary palate, together with limb and cardiovascular phenotypes and\nis caused by mutations in the dTDP-D-Glucose 4,6-dehydratase (TGDS)-encoding gene. The developmental\nand molecular functions of TGDS are unknown but our preliminary data indicate it may function in pathways\nimpacting glycosaminoglycan metabolism. We have used next-generation CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing\napproaches in mice to generate an allelic series that models CMS and enables the study of Tgds function in\nvivo. We propose a series of mouse genetic and quantitative morphometric assays to pinpoint the affected\ndevelopmental processes, which we combine with unbiased transcriptomic, glycomic, and metabolomic\napproaches to build a foundation for understanding CMS etiology and Tgds developmental function. Completion\nof these studies will provide novel insights into the function of an unstudied gene, reveal the etiology of a\ncraniofacial syndrome, and contribute to our fundamental understanding of how metabolic pathways regulate\ncraniofacial development.", "project_title": "Developmental and molecular basis for a craniofacial metabolic syndrome", "phr_text": "Project Narrative\nThis proposal lays a foundation for understanding Catel-Manzke Syndrome, a disease that affects craniofacial\nand skeletal development.

Because S. stercoralis infection is acquired from contact with contaminated soil, those most\nat risk include the socioeconomically disadvantaged, those with agricultural occupations, and those living in\nareas with poor sewage control practices. S. stercoralis larval migration during chronic infection is limited to the\ngastrointestinal tract and lungs and causes few if any symptoms. However, larvae can disseminate and cause\nsevere disease in immunosuppressed individuals. The importance of identifying S. stercoralis infection before\nimmunosuppressive treatments are started has been highlighted by increased use of corticosteroids during the\nCOVID-19 pandemic and related increases in disseminated strongyloidiasis diagnoses. Because disseminated\nstrongyloidiasis is often diagnosed late, after larvae have caused significant and irreversible end-organ\ndamage, the mortality rate of disseminated strongyloidiasis is near 90%.\nRegional studies and case reports indicate that strongyloidiasis is commonly diagnosed in tropical and sub-\ntropical regions of the US. We have found 4-10% seropositivity in a Houston solid organ transplant cohort and,\nmore recently, even higher seropositivity (16.5%) in a central Texas community. Other small studies of US\nimmigrants from low- and middle-income countries have indicated infection rates as high as 46.1%.\nScreening for strongyloidiasis is suboptimal due to poor knowledge of the disease among US healthcare\nproviders and imperfect performance of available diagnostic tests. The clinical gold standard of strongyloidiasis\ndiagnosis is microscopic evaluation of multiple stool specimens for S. stercoralis larva. Unfortunately, it is\nchallenging for patients to submit even one stool specimen in a timely manner, and US clinical laboratory\ntechnicians may not have enough training and expertise to reliably identify larvae. Several serologic tests have\nbeen developed, but commercially available tests have imperfect test performance and are less sensitive in\nimmunocompromised individuals who may not be able to mount a reliable humoral immune response. Newer\nserologic and molecular tests based on recombinant antigens have been developed but are not yet\ncommercially available.\nWe propose a prospective study of adult HHS patients undergoing a panel of parasitologic, serologic, and\nmolecular Strongyloides assays, with the following specific aims: (1) to identify a high-performing\nstrongyloidiasis screening strategy for at-risk individuals living in the US and (2) to evaluate each assay as a\ntest-of-cure for strongyloidiasis. Improvement in Strongyloides testing would improve screening and\nmanagement practices, thereby allowing for timely treatment and reduction of strongyloidiasis related\nmorbidity.", "project_title": "Optimizing Strongyloides Testing in an At-Risk US Population", "phr_text": "PROJECT NARRATIVE\nDue to its autoinfection cycle, Strongyloides stercoralis is one of the few helminths that can cause long\nstanding disease even in infected persons who have departed areas of high endemicity. While strongyloidiasis\ntypically causes few symptoms in immunocompetent persons, if an infected person develops cellular\nimmunocompromise, S. stercoralis can disseminate, leading to severe disease and often irreversible disability\nor death. This research will evaluate a panel of S. stercoralis tests with the goal of identifying (1) an effective,\naccurate, and low-cost screening strategy for at-risk US populations and (2) a test-of-cure that can be used to\nfollow-up cases, thereby preventing potential future morbidity and mortality from disseminated strongyloidiasis.", "spending_categories_desc": null, "agency_code": "NIH",

major control center of the thyroid cell\nand the target of autoimmune thyroid disease. The TSHR is a GPCR on the thyroid cell but is\nnot confined to the thyroid since it has widespread extrathyroidal expression in fibroblasts,\nadipocytes, bone cells and brain tanycytes where they are presumably associated with unique\nroles. Recently, using Molecular Dynamic (MD) simulation studies we identified water channels\nwithin the TSHR transmembrane domain (TMD). Furthermore, using an in vitro assay of water\ntransport in thyrocytes, we have shown that receptor activation with TSH ligand, TSHR specific\nsmall molecules and TSHR stimulating antibodies all enhanced water flow. In this proposal we\nintend to examine the mechanism of TSHR water transport and its link to receptor signaling,\ndiscover novel small molecules that can modulate this water transport leading to physiological\nchanges and marry these observations to translational effects on brain hypothalamic tanycytes.\nTherefore, the specific aims are:\nAim 1: How is water transported within the TSHR- TMD water channels and does water passage\naffect TSHR signaling?\nAim 2: Can we identify novel TSHR specific small molecules that influence water transport?\nAim 3: Does the TSHR water channel influence hypothalamic tanycyte actions?\nThese studies will determine if modulation of TSHR signaling in the thyroid cell and many other\nextra-thyroidal sites is secondary to water channel function and may perturb cellular\nhomeostasis.", "project_title": "TSH Receptor Autoregulation", "phr_text": "PROJECT NARRATIVE\nThe thyroid gland provides thyroid hormone to all the tissues of the body.

carry significant risks, particularly after successful\nsurgery due to the potential for immunological rejection. Aggressive immunosuppressive regimens have been\ndesigned to limit this risk but are fraught with side effects such as increased risk of cancer and infection. More\nprecision immunosuppression that selectively generates tolerance towards donor kidney antigens are necessary,\nbut to date no selective therapies have been developed. Here, we present a proof-of-concept study for a cell-\nbased therapy to generate donor-specific immune tolerance. We will engineer potent tolerogenic dendritic cells\n(tolDCs) that can be infused into donor kidneys prior to transplantation, facilitating presentation of donor antigens\nand influencing antigen specific T regulatory responses; thereby selectively suppressing only donor specific\nimmunity. Our engineered tolDCs, also known as Push/Pull particle tolDCs (PPP-tolDCs) will contain\nmicroparticles loaded with a combination of two synergistic tolerogenic drugs (known as the push/pull particle)\nthat will provide sustained drug release. These push/pull drug combinations were identified via molecular\nscreening and generate tolDCs which influence more potent antigen specific Treg responses. We hypothesize\nthat these two innovations, the push/pull drug combination and encapsulation in sustained release\nmicroparticles, will function cooperatively to generate highly potent, long-lived tolDCs, which in turn generate T\nregulatory responses. In this proposal, we will validate that push/pull drugs can be loaded into microparticles\nand effectively influence na\u00efve dendritic cells towards tolDCs phenotypes by modulating the inhibitor/agonist\nloading ratio. We will further explore PPP-tolDCs interaction with donor-specific kidney antigens from various\nsources and ability to influence donor-specific T regulatory responses. This is the first step in developing PPP-\ntolDCs towards a cell therapy that can generate donor kidney tolerance by being infused into donor kidneys prior\nto transplantation.", "project_title": "Tolerogenic Dendritic Cells via Synergistic Drug Loaded Microparticles for Transplantation Tolerance", "phr_text": "Project Narrative\nLong-term usage of immunosuppressants after transplantation is a serious health risk.

For enteric viruses, which are mostly non-\nenveloped viruses, the current paradigm is that they predominantly egress host cells via an extracellular\nmanner, either as naked cell-free viruses or in membrane-associated forms. Whether enteric viruses can\nefficiently spread through cell-to-cell transmission has not been studied.\n Rotaviruses (RVs) are highly pathogenic human viruses that infect intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and\ncause more than 200,000 children deaths every year. RV infections are also associated with severe diarrheal\ndiseases in the elderly and immunocompromised. The current RV vaccines are significantly less effective in\nlow-to-middle-income countries. There is also a lack of RV-specific and broad-spectrum anti-enteric virus\ntherapeutics. In a recent proteomics study from our laboratory, we found that the RV outer capsid protein VP4\nco-precipitates with multiple subunits of the actin-related protein 2/3 (Arp2/3) complex. IEC-intrinsic Arp2/3\nmediates the migration of IECs from crypts towards the top of the intestinal villi. However, the role of Arp2/3 in\nenteric virus infections is not known. Our new preliminary data suggests that RV cell-to-cell transmission was\ndefective in CRISPR/Cas9 knockout cells that lack Arp2/3 subunits. In addition, chemical inhibition of Arp2/3\nactivity significantly reduced RV fecal shedding and diarrhea in a neonatal mouse model of RV infection. RV\nreplication was also attenuated by Arp2/3 inhibition in fully differentiated human intestinal organoids. We\nhypothesize that VP4 protein binds and co-opts the host Arp2/3 complex in the infected IECs to enable\nRV cell-to-cell spread, which contributes to viral replication and pathogenesis.\n To test this hypothesis, we will leverage our expertise in RV reverse genetics systems, a highly tractable\nmouse model of RV diseases, and state-of-the-art biochemical and imaging techniques. In Aim 1, we will use\nhydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry and proximity ligation assays to determine the biochemical\nproperties, subcellular localization, and timing of VP4-Arp2/3 interactions during RV infection. In Aim 2, we will\ninvestigate the physiological relevance of the Arp2/3 complex in RV infection in vivo using conditional knockout\nmice, 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine labeling, and infectious RVs expressing an mScarlet reporter and chimeric\nVP4s. Collectively, we expect that this study will establish a new model of a successful enteric pathogen\ntaking advantage of cell-to-cell transmission in the milieu of the mucus layer in the intestine to\ncomplement the traditional extracellular way of egress. We may also reveal novel mechanisms by which RV\nalters the migration patterns of infected and bystander IECs to its benefit. Our findings will be instrumental for\ndesigning new antiviral inhibitors and next-generation live-attenuated RV vaccine candidates based on\ntargeting VP4-Arp2/3 interactions to alleviate diarrhea and mortality.", "project_title": "Mechanisms of VP4 Promoting Rotavirus Cell-to-Cell Transmission and Viral Pathogenesis", "phr_text": "Project Narrative\n Rotaviruses are among the most important

Summary/Abstract\nSensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) in military personnel is commonly caused by noise- or blast-related\ndamage to the auditory periphery (cochlea) and/or the central system, which includes changes in the integrity\nof the cochlear partition and cellular death along the auditory pathway. Hearing loss is often permanent, and\nthere exist no cures for sustained injuries. The current proposal seeks to characterize the signal processing\nalong the auditory pathway by establishing the structure-function relationship in both normal ears and with\nvarious types of SNHL. The overall goal is to improve the diagnosis of SNHL within the clinic by separating\ncontributions from cochlear (sensory) and retro-cochlear (neural) loss. We will combine a novel, state-of-the-art\nmeasurement technique (optical coherence tomography, OCT) with recordings that are already available in the\nclinic [i.e., distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) in the ear canal and frequency-following\nresponses (FFR) from the cortex] so that the cochlear mechanics and the detrimental effects of noise- or blast-\nexposure can be evaluated at different stages along the auditory pathway. As of now, OCT measures from the\ncochlea cannot be recorded from humans, but we expect that the combination of DPOAE and FFR provides a\ndifferential diagnosis of SNHL that distinguishes damage of the sensory versus neural component. Aim 1 of\nthis proposal will form the foundation of the study by determining how DPOAEs and FFRs relate to cochlear\nmicromechanics in normal gerbil ears. The experimental results will be used to develop a Best Approximation\nModel (BAM) that will predict cochlear function using DPOAEs and FFRs. In Aim 2 we will explore how various\nforms of SNHL change the underlying cochlear mechanics with the specific design to differentially diagnose\nsensory and neural hearing loss and establish how these changes can be quantified using a combination of\nDPOAE and FFR measurements. These results will further validate the BAM developed under Aim 1. In Aim 3\nwe will apply the knowledge obtained in animals to humans that suffer from different types of SNHL to improve\nthe clinical differential diagnosis of an SNHL using DPOAEs, FFRs, and the BAM. Using direct and\nsimultaneous measurements along the auditory pathway, the signal processing under these conditions will be\nquantified in detail. The proposed research will advance our understanding of sound processing within the\nauditory system, especially at low frequencies that are important for speech and provide critical information to\nimprove our ability to diagnose and develop new treatments for SNHL. This will benefit our Veterans, many of\nwhom suffer from noise/blast-induced hearing loss.", "project_title": "Signal Processing Along the Auditory Pathway:  Changes Following Noise Exposure", "phr_text": "Project Narrative\nLoud sounds can damage your ears and lead to sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). Because of the\nenvironments in which military personnel operate, they are more likely to suffer service-related hearing losses\nthan non-military populations. The mechanism of SNHL is poorly understood because how loud sounds reach\nour inner ear, and how the damage they inflict affects our hearing is not well described. We propose a signal-\nprocessing approach along the entire auditory pathway to resolve this. Combined measurements in the ear\ncanal, within the cochlea, and at the brain will distinguish between noise-induced sensory and neural HL. This\ngreatly enhances rehabilitation strategies that alleviate the burden of hearing loss. The proposed research will\nprovide basic knowledge on how the ear works and explain what changes due to noise-induced damage. It\nalso contributes to the diagnosis of sensory or neural loss, which directly benefits military personnel, Veterans,\nand civilians suffering from SNHL.", "spending_categories_desc": null,

"Editing hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) at the genetic level is a rapidly progressing field that has the potential\nto revolutionize the treatment of genetic blood disorders and related diseases. However, the effective\nimplementation of HSCs therapy is hampered by challenges in the lack of efficient delivery of the CRISPR/Cas9\nsystem into HSCs. Novel technologies that improve delivery efficiency and enable precise gene editing, hold\ngreat promise in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT)-based therapy. Here, the overall goal of this R15\nproposal is to develop nucleic acids nanoparticle (NANP) technology for efficiently delivering the CRISPR/Cas9\nsystem into HSCs, to guide genome editing. Precise control of the geometry, composition, structural switch, and\nspecific ligand-receptor interactions of NANPs, will significantly enhance the delivery efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9,\nand improve the targeting precision of gene editing, while also decreasing off-target effects and minimizing\npotential toxicity. We will employ multidisciplinary approaches to assess the delivery efficiency of NANPs and\nthe outcomes of genome editing in HSCs and relevant cell lines. We will also demonstrate its potential for gene\nknockout (KO) and knock-in (KI) to treat sickle cell disease.\nInnovation: Compared to traditional methods, NANPs offer several innovative features, including: (1) enhanced\ncellular uptake by controlling the shape and size of NANPs and spatial organization of ligand-receptor\ninteractions; (2) enabling direct delivery of CRISPR/Cas into target cells, eliminating the necessity for mRNA\ndelivery and translation; (3) facilitated cytosolic release and delivery of Cas9/sgRNA to nucleus by switchable\nNANP structures; (4) minimized toxicity by optimizing NANPs\u2019 composition. These distinctive NANP\ncharacteristics should enhance the efficiency of gene delivery, improving targeting precision and efficacy of gene\nediting in HSCs. The proposed research will employ an interdisciplinary approach, incorporating nucleic acid\nnanotechnology, computation-guided design, CRISPR technology, and stem cell biology. The knowledge gained\nwill not only progress gene delivery and genome editing, but also contribute to the broader field of nanomedicine.\nSignificance and impact: The significance of this research lies in its potential to revolutionize treatment of\nvarious genetic disorders by enabling precise genome editing in HSCs. Successful in vitro delivery of\nCRISPR/Cas9 to HSCs could enhance HSCT-based therapy, offering the opportunity to correct disease-causing\nmutations, introduce therapeutic genes, and bolster the body's natural defense mechanisms against genetic\ndisorders. Developing efficient NANP-based gene delivery to HSCs not only has significant clinical implications\nbut could also contribute to our broader understanding of stem cell biology and gene therapy. This research's\nbroad impact would enhance patient outcomes and provide hope for individuals and families affected by genetic\ndisorders. For R15\u2019s educational goals, it would improve Biomedical Sciences and STEM education at Rutgers-\nCamden and the Coriell Institute by involving graduate and undergraduate students in all research stages.", "project_title": "R15: Enhancement of Genome Editing in Hematopoietic Stem Cells by Nucleic Acids Nanoparticles Delivery of CRISPR/CAS System", "phr_text": "Project Narrative\nWe propose to develop a nucleic acids nanoparticles technology for the efficient delivery of\ngenetic materials into hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to guide genome editing.

disorders, has been\nestimated to affect approximately 5.4% of the U.S. adult population each year. Research shows low rates of\nevidence-based treatment being provided to patients with SMI. This is unfortunate, because evidence-based\npsychological therapies have been shown to be effective for improving outcomes in SMI. One such efficacious\npsychological intervention is mindfulness-based therapy (MBT), which integrates mindfulness practice with\ncognitive-behavioral strategies to improve illness management. Previous trials conducted in the United\nKingdom have shown that MBT improves symptoms and functioning in community-based outpatients with SMI,\nincluding in routine practice settings. In the U.S., most patients with SMI receive treatment at local community\nmental health centers (CMHCs). However, patients in CMHCs often cannot access evidence-based therapies\nlike MBT due to the lack of trained staff able to provide these interventions. Further, previous studies of MBT\nhave been conducted exclusively outside the U.S. It is essential to confirm that MBT is effective when\ndelivered for patients with SMI in the U.S., and how it can be sustainably implemented in CMHCs where this\nclinical population is commonly treated. Thus, we propose to test the effectiveness of MBT for SMI and study\nits implementation in a typical CMHC setting. Additionally we will specify a certified training program in MBT for\nfrontline clinicians, given the differences between U.K. and U.S. healthcare systems. To speed translation to\nclinical practice, we also will collect information from diverse community partners on implementation barriers\nand facilitators to promote future uptake. We will randomize 160 patients with SMI (psychotic-spectrum and\nmajor mood disorders) to receive treatment as usual (TAU) vs TAU plus MBT delivered by frontline clinicians in\na large, diverse CMHC. We will conduct blinded assessments at baseline and at 6- (mid), 12- (post), and 24-\nweeks (follow-up). Consistent with an experimental therapeutics approach, we will examine potential\nmechanisms of action (e.g., mindfulness skills), as well as collect implementation-focused quantitative and\nqualitative data from our community partners (patients, administrators, clinicians). If found to be effective and\naided by a certified training program and the implementation data collected, MBT could be adopted as a future\nevidence-based practice and integrated into the routine community care of patients with SMI, thereby reducing\nhealth disparities.", "project_title": "Evaluating the Effectiveness of Mindfulness-Based Therapy for SMI Implemented in a Community Mental Health Setting", "phr_text": "Project Narrative\nIndividuals with severe mental illness often lack access to evidence-based mindfulness therapies in community\nmental health centers, even though mindfulness been shown to improve symptoms and functioning, and\npatients and clinicians express interest in this approach.

increasing\nregulations, administrative and clerical duties, clinical workloads, malpractice lawsuits, and less time with\npatients. As a result, stress, fatigue, psychological distress, depression, burnout, and career dissatisfaction\namong providers are prevalent. In addition to impacting providers directly, poor well-being can negatively\nimpact healthcare organizations and reduce quality of care, patient safety and patient satisfaction. Additionally,\nprovider burnout, stress, and workload have been associated with poorer hand hygiene adherence, which can\nincrease the risk of healthcare-associated infection (HAI). Hand hygiene is a key element of preventing HAI,\nyet maintaining healthcare provider adherence to this basic practice remains challenging. Achieving optimal\nhand hygiene adherence requires minimizing cognitive biases, such as perceived low odds of spreading\ninfections by not properly performing hand hygiene. Unfortunately, cognitive bias is a known barrier to clinician\ndecision-making. Mindfulness is an approach that can help clinicians shed preconceived biases through\nnonjudgmental awareness and more broadly facilitate improvements in patient safety.\nSignificance: A hand hygiene-based mindfulness intervention targeted at Veterans Health Administration\n(VHA) providers could improve hand hygiene practices and thereby enhance patient outcomes. Additionally,\nincorporating brief mindfulness practices during moments of hand hygiene has the potential to directly improve\nprovider well-being.\nInnovation and Impact: While targeted interventions and bundled approaches to improve hand hygiene\nadherence and reduce HAI have been implemented, interventions incorporating introspective techniques, such\nas mindfulness, are limited. In a recent single-site pilot study, team members of this proposed study found that\na brief mindfulness intervention improved hand hygiene and mindful attention among physicians. The proposed\nstudy will expand on this pilot work by more broadly testing the hand hygiene-based mindfulness intervention\nwith both physicians and nurses, and by including a specific focus on provider well-being. The goal is to\noptimize provider hand hygiene adherence, improve provider well-being and enhance the quality and safety of\ncare delivered to Veterans.\nSpecific Aims: We have three specific aims: 1) To evaluate the effectiveness of a hand hygiene-based\nmindfulness intervention on provider hand hygiene adherence, duration, and perceptions. 2) To evaluate the\neffectiveness of a hand hygiene-based mindfulness intervention on measures of provider mindfulness and\nwell-being. 3) To identify the barriers, facilitators, and perceptions of a hand hygiene-based mindfulness\nintervention in the hospital.\nMethodology: We will conduct a randomized controlled mixed-methods trial at 2 diverse VHA hospitals.\nPhysicians and nurses randomized to the intervention arm will receive mindfulness education and tools to\nprompt mindfulness during hand hygiene. Measures of hand hygiene (adherence, duration, and perceptions)\nand measures of provider mindfulness and well-being will be collected and compared between the intervention\nand control groups.\nNext Steps/Implementation: We will work with our proposed partners to review our study findings, modify our\nintervention as needed, and disseminate our findings through the various partnership channels. At the\nconclusion of this project, we will have a hand hygiene-based mindfulness intervention package that we can\nsubsequently work to deploy more broadly across VHA hospitals to improve the safety of Veterans and the\nwell-being of those providing their healthcare.", "project_title": "Mindful Hand Hygiene to Reduce Infections Among Veterans While Enhancing ProviderWell-Being", "phr_text": "This study will test whether a hand hygiene-based mindfulness intervention can improve provider hand hygiene\nadherence, improve provider well-being, and enhance Veteran outcomes.

infect most humans for life and cause skin sores, blindness,\nencephalitis, developmental abnormalities, and disseminated disease. No vaccines are yet available, and current\ntherapeutics are non-curative. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new prophylactic and therapeutic\ninterventions. Being enveloped, HSV-1 and HSV-2 penetrate target host cells by fusing their lipid envelopes with\ncellular membranes. This process requires several viral proteins \u2013 gD, gH, gL, and gB \u2013 each of which performs\ndistinct functions. This contrasts with most enveloped viruses, which combine all entry functions in one protein.\nSuch distribution of functions raises the question of how these proteins act, how they coordinate their activities\nto ensure efficient membrane fusion and viral entry, and how best to target them for vaccine development. High-\nresolution structures of the individual glycoproteins and stable complexes, such as gH/gL, have been\nindispensable for guiding functional, mechanistic, and immunological studies. But little is known about how these\nglycoproteins interact. High-resolution structural \u201csnapshots\u201d of glycoprotein complexes relevant to entry would\nhelp answer many outstanding mechanistic questions, but complexes have been difficult to isolate, so no\nstructures of complexes (beyond that of gH/gL) are yet available. The current application proposes to apply new\nmethods to isolate HSV glycoprotein complexes and characterize their structures by cryoEM. Aim 1 will use\nantibodies to stabilize gD/gH/gL complexes and characterize their structures. Aim 2 will use non-detergent\nextraction methods to isolate HSV gH/gL/gB complexes and characterize their structures. The proposal will\nleverage extensive experience in biochemical and structural studies of HSV glycoproteins as well as a newly\nestablished cryoEM pipeline. A detailed structural and biochemical knowledge of how HSV glycoproteins interact\nto facilitate cell entry will open new opportunities for rational vaccine and therapeutics design.", "project_title": "Capturing HSV entry glycoprotein complexes", "phr_text": "PROJECT NARRATIVE\nHerpes simplex viruses (HSV-1 and HSV-2) infect most humans for life and cause a great disease burden, for\nwhich no vaccines or curative therapies are yet available.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), prevalent among Veterans, puts Veterans at increased\nrisk for obesity and related conditions. Veterans with PTSD lose less weight in VA\u2019s MOVE! weight\nmanagement program, due to PTSD symptoms that interfere with activity and healthy diet. In addition, many\nVeterans who receive evidence-based PTSD treatment remain symptomatic. A behavioral weight loss program\nthat augments standard PTSD care and targets PTSD-related weight loss barriers called MOVE!+UP was\npiloted and iteratively refined among 44 overweight Veterans with PTSD. The fully developed MOVE!+UP is\nled by a psychologist and a Veteran peer support counselor, who provide complementary expertise. It includes\n16 in-person group sessions with 90 minutes of general weight loss support, coupled with Cognitive Behavior\nTherapy skills to address PTSD-specific barriers. Each session also includes a 30-minute community walk to\naddress hypervigilance-based activity barriers and enhance classroom-based learning. Veterans receive two\nindividual dietician visits, and counseling calls as needed. The cohort receiving the final MOVE!+UP package\nreported high satisfaction and had better weight loss outcomes than Veterans with PTSD in the general MOVE!\nprogram. They also reported substantial PTSD symptom reduction. Treatment targets like eating behaviors,\nactivity, and insomnia also improved. MOVE!+UP effectiveness must be tested in a randomized trial.\nSignificance/Impact: MOVE!+UP is timely and efficient, simultaneously addressing physical and mental\nhealth of a priority Veteran group. MOVE!+UP is positioned to address HSR&D priorities by promoting mental\nhealth and improving PTSD symptoms, access to care, and whole health. This study is aligned with HSR&D\nand ORD methodological priorities by using a hybrid type 1 trial. This study\u2019s cost and utilization analyses, and\nsystematic identification of implementation barriers and facilitators, would place effectiveness findings in\ncontext and facilitate rapid translation to the field if MOVE!+UP is effective. This study will also provide insights\nabout ways that general MOVE! and PTSD care can be enhanced to improve reach and effectiveness.\nInnovation: MOVE!+UP is the first weight loss program designed to address obesity in Veterans with PTSD.\nSpecific Aims: This study proposes to randomize overweight/obese Veterans with PTSD enrolled in PTSD\ncare to usual care enhanced with enrollment in MOVE! (control) or usual care enhanced with MOVE!+UP\n(intervention), and is guided by three aims: 1) Test whether intervention participants have greater 6-month\nweight loss (primary outcome), and 6-month PTSD symptom reduction and 12-month weight loss (secondary\nexploratory outcomes), relative to controls; 2) Assess whether compared to control, intervention participants\nhave greater improvements on 6-month treatment targets: physical activity, eating behavior, insomnia,\ndepression, and social support; 3) Estimate intervention and control condition costs and utilization, and identify\nMOVE!+UP implementation barriers and facilitators, to contextualize Aim 1 and inform future implementation.\nMethodology: Hybrid type 1 trial with 164 overweight/obese Veterans with PTSD enrolled in PTSD care.\nImplementation/Next Steps: This hybrid type 1 trial will provide data needed to prepare a MOVE!+UP\nimplementation package for broader VA implementation if MOVE!+UP is effective. If it is not effective, Aims 2\nand 3 will help understand how overweight Veterans with PTSD could be better supported in the future.\nImplementation activities would be coordinated with existing local, VISN, and national operational partners.", "project_title": "MOVE!+UP: Testing a Tailored Weight Management Program for Veterans with PTSD", "phr_text": "Project Narrative\nPosttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is common among Veterans and results in poor psychological\nfunctioning, quality of life, and physical health. This includes having disproportionately high rates of obesity, in\npart due to PTSD symptoms interfering with physical activity and healthy diet. Unfortunately, Veterans with\nPTSD have poorer weight loss outcomes than those without PTSD in VA\u2019s existing weight management\nprogram, MOVE!. Based on pilot work, it appears that a weight management program that augments standard\nPTSD care and targets PTSD-related barriers to weight loss improves weight and PTSD symptoms. Whether it\nimproves these issues more than standard VA care is in need of study, which is the focus of the proposed\nresearch. The proposed study also seeks to understand factors that would interfere with and facilitate\nimplementing the program in VA if it is effective.

"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nResearch on the biological origins of psychopathology has largely focused on isolated levels of analyses and\ndiscrete illness categories. Moreover, most in vivo imaging efforts only consider a single point in time\u2014\nessentially ignoring the temporal variability of behavior. To establish illness etiologies, we must account for\ndiagnostic heterogeneity, longitudinal change, and genetic risks. Emerging evidence from large population-\nbased studies of healthy populations indicates that individual differences in behavior are reflected in variability\nacross the collective set of functional brain connections (functional connectome). These data suggest that the\nspectra of symptom profiles observed in patient populations may arise through detectable patterns of network\nfunction, with the disturbance of individual systems preferentially contributing to domain-specific (e.g.,\nexecutive, affective, and social), but disorder-general, impairments. Critically, genetic factors influence the\nfunctioning of large-scale networks. Spatial patterns of gene transcription can show strong correspondence\nwith network topography, potentially driving comorbidity between symptomatically related disorders. However,\nwhile recent work suggests a genetic basis for the macro-scale organization of the cortical sheet, the extent to\nwhich local cellular profiles may underpin the functional properties of the brain and contribute to associated\nsymptom profiles remains to be established. To address the disconnect between mechanism and nosology,\nthe NIMH strategic plan calls for a bottom-up reappraisal of psychopathology across multiple levels of analysis;\nfacilitating the study of relationships from genes to neural circuits and networks through behavior, cutting\nacross disorders as traditionally defined. Directly addressing these objectives, the proposed research will link\nindividual variation in functional connectomes with longitudinal changes in symptom profiles across unipolar\ndepression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia through the combined application of neuroimaging, behavioral,\nand genomic methods. Building upon our prior work, we will generate individual-level brain-based predictions\nof multidimensional symptom profiles, defining clinical subtypes by clustering participants according to distinct\npatterns of functional connectivity (Aim 1). Second, we will map transdiagnostic functional connectome\nvariability to longitudinal trajectories of clinical presentation, deriving predictive models of temporal changes\nacross symptom profiles (Aim 2). Third, we will investigate the cellular underpinnings of the human cortical\nconnectome across health and disease. In doing so, we will identify the cellular associates of network function,\nestablish their relationship to in vivo connectome functioning, and assess co-heritability with illness risk (Aim\n3). Linking functional connectomes to individual differences in symptom expression, longitudinal changes in\nclinically relevant behaviors, and associated cellular and genetic factors represents a tremendous opportunity\nfor the field.

The accurate diagnosis of aggressive PCa is critical for the survival of patients.\nTransrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided biopsy, the current standard procedure for evaluating the presence and\naggressiveness of PCa, suffers from low core yield, leading to under-sampling and under-grading of clinically\nsignificant tumors. To solve the long-standing challenges in PCa diagnosis, we propose to develop a real-time\nfunctional imaging platform with the unique capability of quantitatively evaluating both heterogeneous gland\nmicroarchitecture and anomalous chemical microenvironment in tumors for accurate diagnosis and prognosis of\nPCa. The proposed functional imaging platform is made possible by the recent advancement in photoacoustic\n(PA) imaging and biocompatible polyacrylamide hydrogel nanoscale probes (PAA NPs). Besides drastically\nenhancing the sensitivity and specificity of PA imaging in detecting the tumors, the PAA NPs conjugated with\ncancer-targeting ligands can be a carrier of versatile contrast agents for PA chemical imaging, offering unique\nopportunities for PCa diagnosis and characterization in both preclinical and clinical settings.\nThe central hypothesis of this research is that the PA imaging, when powered by the functional PAA NPs, can\nenable sensitive detection of PCa tumors and accurate characterization of PCa aggressiveness in vivo by\nquantitatively assessing a list of imaging biomarkers reflecting prostate gland microarchitecture and cancer\nmicroenvironment. The objective of this project is to understand the performance and limitations of the PAA NP\npowered PA imaging in PCa tumor detection and characterization of cancer aggressiveness via the experiments\nin clinically relevant mouse models of PCa. To examine the central hypothesis and pave the road toward future\nclinical application, this research will focus on the following specific aims: Aim 1. Optimize PAA NPs for chemical\nimaging of the tumor microenvironment, targeting PCa tumors, and staining prostate microarchitectures; Aim 2.\nUnderstand the performance of PAA NP powered PA imaging in characterizing the aggressiveness of PCa via\nstudies in clinically relevant mouse models of PCa; and Aim 3. Develop a multivariate strategy for PCa diagnosis\nand prognosis by combining the multiple cancer biomarkers from PAA NP powered PA imaging. The successful\naccomplishment of this project will lead to a prototype PA imaging platform with its performance in assessing the\naggressiveness of PCa comprehensively evaluated. In the future, the proposed imaging procedure can be\nseamless integrated into the framework of TRUS guided PCa biopsy to improve the core yields and decrease\nthe false negative rates. Moreover, the proposed PAA NP contrast agents specifically designed for PA molecular\nand chemical imaging can facilitate a platform technology for understand cancer microenvironment, not only for\nPCa but also for other types of solid tumors.", "project_title": "Detecting prostate cancer aggressiveness using photoacoustic chemical imaging with photoacoustic spectral analysis", "phr_text": "NARRATIVE\nProposed here is a novel laser and ultrasound based imaging platform which, by working together with nano-\nsize particles carrying functional dyes, may allow not only sensitive detection of prostate cancer but also accurate\ndifferentiation between aggressive and non-aggressive tumors.

disease characterized by eosinophilic infiltration\nof the esophagus, esophageal dysfunction, and progressive fibrosis. EoE is the most common cause of\ndysphagia, esophageal perforation, and food impaction. The annual cost of EoE in the United States is\nestimated to be in the range of $1 billion, and its prevalence is currently approaching that of inflammatory\nbowel disease. However, little is known about how EoE occurs, and the diagnostic approach involves highly\ninvasive procedures. Currently, available treatments include topical steroid therapy or dietary elimination,\nthough achieving the long-term efficacy of the former and regularly avoiding particular foods can present\nchallenges. Therefore, understanding how EoE occurs is essential to developing a more effective diagnostic\nand treatment approach for EoE.\n Research to date indicates that T helper type 2 (Th2) cells reacting to specific food antigens likely cause\nEoE and that the symptoms are limited to the esophagus. Therefore, it is likely that Th2 cells that migrate\nspecifically to the esophagus mediate the symptoms. Indeed, recent research has shown that the esophageal\nbiopsies of active EoE patients contain Th2 cells, which express a molecule called GPR15. Our group first\ndiscovered that GPR15 is a receptor necessary for T cells to migrate to the large intestine. Furthermore, we\nfound that a molecule known as C10ORF99 in the large intestine functions as a ligand for GPR15 to complete\nthe migration. Additionally, publicly accessible databases demonstrated the high expression of C10ORF99 in\nthe esophagus. Therefore, the GPR15-C10ORF99 combination may mediate T cell homing to the esophagus\nand pathogenesis during EoE. In that case, GPR15 and C10ORF99 may be useful diagnostic markers and\ntherapeutic targets for EoE.

While the best characterized sncRNAs are those associated with Argonaute family proteins, such as\nmicroRNAs (miRNAs) and PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), recent research has uncovered other functional\nsncRNA classes with distinct properties, biogenesis, and functions. During the biogenesis of sncRNAs,\nenzymatic cleavages of precursor molecules leave various terminal formations, such as hydroxyl (OH),\nphosphate (P), or 2\u2032,3\u2032-cyclic phosphate (cP). However, the majority of RNA-seq data for sncRNAs to date has\nbeen generated using standard RNA-seq methods, which predominantly capture sncRNAs with 5\u2032-P and 3\u2032-OH\nends, like miRNAs. SncRNAs with other terminal structures cannot be ligated to the 5\u2032- and/or 3\u2032-adaptors, and\nthus remain unrecognized by standard RNA-seq methods. This limitation results in the exclusion of non-miRNA-\nsncRNAs lacking the 5\u2032-P/3\u2032-OH ends from expression analyses, keeping them uncharacterized. This study\nspecifically focuses on short cP-containing RNAs (cP-RNAs) which contain a cP at their 3\u2032-end and thus are\nabsent in standard RNA-seq data. Despite being largely undetected in standard RNA-seq analyses, numerous\ncP-RNAs have been identified as functional sncRNAs. A representative example is the 5\u2032-tRNA halves produced\nthrough anticodon cleavage of tRNAs by the angiogenin endoribonuclease. These cP-RNAs play significant roles\nin various biological processes, including stress response, cell proliferation, and immune response. By\ndeveloping cP-RNA-seq, which can specifically sequence cP-RNAs, we have performed a genome-wide\nexpression analysis of short cP-RNAs across various cells and tissues, revealing that: 1) cP-RNAs are generated\nnot from random degradation but through regulated biogenesis pathways; 2) cP-RNAs constitute a significant\nportion of sncRNAs (15\u201360 nucleotides) in cells, tissues, and in extracellular vesicles; and 3) expression levels\nand profiles of cP-RNAs are regulated by various factors such as hormone signaling pathways, aging, oxidative\nstress, and infection. We propose cP-RNAs as promising research subjects due to their diverse physiological\nfunctions in various biological processes. Moving forward, our research will focus not only on identifying which\ncP-RNAs are expressed, but more importantly on understanding the regulation of their biogenesis and\nelucidating their molecular functions. Recently, we have discovered RNase Kappa as a novel enzyme generating\ncP-RNAs, along with two new proteins that interact with and stabilize cP-RNAs. Our proposed study will involve\ncharacterizing the roles of these factors in the regulation of cP-RNA expression and investigating the functional\nsignificance of their generated/stabilized cP-RNAs in piRNA biogenesis, regulation of mRNA stability, and\nimmune receptor activations during immune response, which will help achieve our goal of understanding cP-\nRNA biology and realizing its broader implications for human health and disease.", "project_title": "Biogenesis and function of cyclic phosphate-containing RNAs", "phr_text": "Project Narrative\nShort non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) play crucial roles in various biological processes, yet the cyclic phosphate-\ncontaining RNAs (cP-RNAs) within this group remain largely uncharacterized due to limitations in standard RNA-\nseq.

While family\nsupport and encouragement are powerful facilitators of Veterans\u2019 mental health care engagement, few\ninterventions have been developed that capitalize on this support. To address this gap, VA created Coaching\nInto Care (CIC) \u2013 a national telephone-based coaching service intended to educate, support, and empower\nfamily members and friends who are seeking services for a Veteran. While program evaluation data show that\nCIC is highly valued by callers, only about 25% of callers with Veterans not already in care, report that their\nVeteran sought care over the next six months. The proposed study tests an innovative approach to improve\nthe effectiveness of CIC by integrating a web program called VA Community Reinforcement and Family Training\n(VA-CRAFT), which is based on an empirically-validated intervention. The long-term goal is to establish an\nefficacious, efficient, scalable, and satisfying family outreach intervention that will significantly increase mental\nhealth service initiation among a high priority Veteran population while addressing the needs of their primary\nsupporters, their family members.\nBackground: PTSD is a highly prevalent psychiatric disorder among combat Veterans that often results in\nsignificant individual impairment and distress for family members. Although evidence-based treatments are\navailable, most Veterans with PTSD do not receive any mental health care. Preliminary work suggests that\nVA\u2019s Coaching Into Care services could be improved by integrating VA-CRAFT. In a prior HSR&D-funded pilot,\nour team found that family members who completed the relatively brief VA-CRAFT course alone (without\ncoaching) had greater decreases in caregiver burden than wait-list controls. However, qualitative interviews\nalso suggested that participants often did not raise the issue of treatment with their Veteran due to not believing\nsuch a conversation would be successful. Therefore, we developed CIC+VA-CRAFT to leverage the strengths\nof both approaches to increase family members\u2019 motivation, perceived ability to have treatment-seeking\nconversations with their Veteran, and success at engaging their Veterans in care. Initial findings from an NC-\nPTSD-funded pilot of CIC+VA-CRAFT suggest that this brief, blended intervention is feasible, acceptable, and\npotentially more effective than CIC alone in enhancing Veteran mental health treatment initiation.\nObjectives: This project will employ a two-group randomized controlled trial (RCT) to compare CIC+VA-\nCRAFT to CIC only (treatment as usual). Specific aims are to: 1) Determine the effectiveness of CIC+VA-\nCRAFT in enhancing Veterans\u2019 mental health service initiation compared to CIC only; 2) Determine if CIC+VA-\nCRAFT is non-inferior to CIC only on caller satisfaction, and 3) Conduct a process evaluation to inform potential\nfuture implementation of CIC+VA-CRAFT. The project will also explore potential 1) treatment effects on other\nimportant family-related outcomes, and 2) mediators and moderators of treatment. This proposal was\ndeveloped as a collaboration between the VA CIC and VA-CRAFT programs and their leadership, which will\nfacilitate the intervention\u2019s rapid dissemination should the trial prove successful.\nMethods: This is a four-year RCT that will recruit spouses or intimate partners of Veterans with PTSD using\nsocial media advertisements and referrals from CIC. Participating partners will be randomized to the CIC+VA-\nCRAFT (n = 115) or CIC only (n = 115) condition for up to three months. CIC+VA-CRAFT will include four\nmanualized CIC phone-coaching calls and access to the VA-CRAFT website. CIC participants will receive only\nCIC services as usual. Assessments will be at baseline, post-intervention (3 months after randomization), and\nsix-month follow-up and will include partner reports of Veteran service utilization, caregiver burden, wellbeing,\nand relationship functioning. The feasibility and acceptability of implementing CIC+VA-CRAFT will be assessed\nwith interviews of CIC+VA-CRAFT participants, Veterans of participants, and study and CIC phone coaches.", "project_title": "A Randomized Controlled Trial of Coaching into Care with VA-CRAFT to Promote Veteran Engagement in PTSD Care", "phr_text": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) afflicts many war Veterans, but often they are reluctant to seek help despite\navailability of effective treatments.

within and across biological samples. Recent technological advances\nallow sequencing of entire transcripts, enhancing isoform identification and allele expression\nanalysis. As with short read RNA-seq, iterative algorithm development with design\nconsiderations towards the data and metadata infrastructure is key to support accurate scientific\nconclusions and facilitate computational reproducibility for users. Many specialized bioinformatic\nmethods are available for long read data that are able to detect novel transcripts and to adapt\nalgorithms for quantification of transcript abundance to the particular characteristics of long\nreads. However there is a need for easy-to-use pipelines for multi-sample analysis that can be\nrun by biologists or other analysts without advanced bioinformatic training, covering read\nprocessing, feature discovery, quantification, feature aggregation, and inference/visualization.\nWe aim to provide such a modular pipeline with enhanced accuracy, interpretability, and\nreproducibility for long read RNA-seq, easily deployable on cloud platforms such as AnVIL. The\nteam of investigators has substantial experience developing efficient and easy-to-use tools for\ntranscriptomics analysis, having designed ultra-fast algorithms for sequence read processing,\nmodular pipelines leveraging best-in-class methods from abundance estimation to statistical\nanalysis, and end-user workflows that are widely used in research labs in academic institutes\nand industry. The goal of the project is to develop and enhance RNA-seq analysis tools for new\nlong read datasets, focusing on improving accuracy and interpretability, in particular for\nmulti-sample datasets. In this proposal, we will 1) expand quantification tools for long read\nRNA-seq including novel models for quantification and correction for errors and technical bias;\n2) simplify multi-sample analysis with high-level tools that augment processing steps, extend our\nautomatic provenance detection framework to support new use cases in long read, and support\ndata-driven feature aggregation; and 3) broaden user engagement by publishing workflows and\ntutorials, and hosting in-person and virtual workshops on AnVIL. The impact of this work will be\nto deliver software for long read RNA-seq that is user-friendly, integrates with existing pipelines,\nand is made accessible on cloud platforms like AnVIL.", "project_title": "A Modular Framework for Accurate, Interpretable, and Reproducible Analysis of Long Read RNA-Seq Data", "phr_text": "PROJECT NARRATIVE\nRNA sequencing is a key assay in biomedical research, allowing researchers to study the role\nof genes in human health and disease.

evolution. Among variants, little is known\nabout de novo structural variants (SVs) that are rare and difficult to identify, but can affect genome integrity more\nthan point mutations due to their larger size (\u226550 bp). Furthermore, how de novo SVs originate in the germline\nis not fully understood. Meiosis is a potential source, because of the abundance of DNA double-strand breaks\n(DSBs) that are deliberately formed by the SPO11 protein to initiate meiotic recombination. While recombination\nensures the reductional division of diploid cells and thus is essential for the formation of haploid gametes, DSBs\nare intrinsically mutagenic. My research program will address the mechanisms and factors that promote aberrant\nrepair at meiotic DSBs, resulting in genome alterations. We recently discovered in mice that closely spaced\nDSBs (double cuts) can undergo end joining, leading to de novo SVs, including deletions and tandem\nduplications. These events are rare in normal meiosis, but arise more frequently in the absence of the ATM\nkinase, which has a conserved role in regulating DSBs. Many genomic locations are at risk for end joining, as\nmeiotic DSBs are formed at hotspots, many of which are separated by short genomic distances (<10 kb). In\naddition, double cuts within a single hotspot can initiate smaller deletions, and released DNA fragments can\ninsert at other genomic sites undergoing DSBs. Thus, we uncovered new types of meiosis-specific mutational\nevents, which are also predicted to arise at human recombination hotspots. However, the underlying molecular\nmechanisms remain unclear. Next generation sequencing technologies, innovative molecular assays,\ncomputational tools, and mouse mutants will be utilized to define which end joining pathway(s) is employed, how\nit operates in the context of SPO11-induced DSBs, and what factors promote its use. We focus on the classical\nand alternative nonhomologous end-joining pathways, known to repair mitotic breaks in mammalian cells, but\nwe also hypothesize that single strand annealing may be used at hotspots flanked by repeats. Furthermore, we\nwill expand our findings in mouse models to investigate de novo SVs at nearby DSBs in human meiosis. Here,\nin addition, we will ask whether age or specific genetic factors enhance illegitimate repair at meiotic DSBs. This\nresearch will advance our understanding of the mutagenic potential of the meiotic genome and the origin of de\nnovo mutations in humans.", "project_title": "Germline Mutagenesis at Recombination Hotspots", "phr_text": "Project Narrative\nIn meiosis, programmed DNA double-strand breaks initiate meiotic recombination, which is essential for the\ndevelopment of healthy gametes and thus reproduction.

Chest pain\nis the second most common cause of ED visits and most common reason for short-stay hospitalizations. During\nthese hospitalizations patients undergo in-depth evaluations (stress testing, computed tomography coronary\nangiography, or invasive angiography), but ultimately <10% are diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome (ACS).\nThese evaluations cost $3 billion annually and strain health system resources without clear evidence of improved\nhealth outcomes or patient experience. Our preliminary data suggest that moderate risk patients (35% of patients\nwith chest pain) can be safely managed as outpatients using a cardiovascular ambulatory rapid evaluation\n(CARE) strategy as an alternative to hospitalization. In the CARE strategy, patients are discharged from the ED\nand receive outpatient clinic follow-up within 72 hours focused on medical management for cardiovascular risk\nfactors (e.g., hypertension, diabetes) and determining whether further cardiac testing is needed. This strategy\naims to enhance patient-centered outcomes while safely and equitably decreasing hospital resource utilization.\nHowever, equipoise exists between outpatient and hospitalization strategies for moderate risk patients. There is\na paucity of prospective data evaluating the efficacy and patient-centeredness of outpatient chest pain evaluation\nstrategies in moderate risk patients. Thus, it is unclear whether use of an outpatient chest pain management\nstrategy (CARE) will safely reduce healthcare utilization and be preferred by patients compared to a traditional\nhospitalization strategy. To address this key evidence gap, we propose the first prospective multisite randomized\ntrial testing outpatient vs hospitalization strategies in moderate risk patients. Our experienced research team will\nrandomize 502 patients 1:1 to the CARE or hospitalization management arms at three ED sites with a history of\nhigh recruitment rates and productive collaborations in cardiovascular clinical trials. The primary outcome will be\nhospital-free days (HFD) over a 30-day period. Patient-centered outcomes, such as patient satisfaction and\nexperience and out-of-pocket cost will be assessed at 30-days. Additional endpoints include HFD over 1-year,\n30-day and 1-year cardiovascular HFD, rates of noninvasive and invasive cardiac testing, cardiovascular\nrehospitalizations, and cardiovascular repeat ED visits. Patients will be monitored for safety: the composite of\ncardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and unplanned coronary revascularization at 30-days. This novel\ntrial addresses a key evidence gap by providing guidance on how best to evaluate moderate risk ED patients\nwith acute chest pain. Without this guidance care patterns are likely to remain heterogeneous, inefficient, non-\npatient-centered, and unguided by the highest level of evidence. We hypothesize that data from this trial will\nsupport widespread implementation of a CARE strategy, which could improve the quality and value of care for\nmillions of patients in the U.S. and beyond.", "project_title": "Testing a Cardiovascular Ambulatory Rapid Evaluation for Patients with Chest Pain (CARE-CP)", "phr_text": "PROJECT NARRATIVE\nEach year 7 million patients seek care in U.S. Emergency Departments for chest pain.

While these myeloma precursor conditions\n(MPC) are found in 3-5% of the adult population, only a small fraction will ultimately progress to MM. The ability\nto identify high-risk patients before major clonal expansion and symptoms arise has the potential to enable\nstrategies of early prevention, which currently represents one of the most important unmet clinical needs. In the\nlast four years, our group has shown for the first time that bulk whole genome sequencing (WGS) is the only\ntechnology able to comprehensively identify the key MM defining genomic events such as chromothripsis,\nAPOBEC mutational activity, mutations in distinct driver genes. These events are emerging as critical to\ndifferentiate progressive from stable MPC. Despite its comprehensive resolution, bulk WGS has intrinsic\nlimitations in defining small subclones, which often drive the MPC progression into MM. This limitation also\naffects our understanding of the early disease life-history and the early identification of MPC destined to progress.\nTo overcome this, we have successfully explored a novel single-cell WGS platform (direct library preparation;\nDLP+) to fully characterize the subclonal genomic complexity and plasticity in each phase of MM evolution.\nThanks to this unprecedent resolution combined with single cell RNA of the immune microenvironment, this\nstudy will allow to comprehensively define the clinical impact of MM defining genomic and immune events among\nMPC, allowing to differentiate benign from malignant entities. Among the key MM defining genomic events\nAPOBEC mutational activity is the most prevalent and its presence is emerging as one of the most sensitive\nprognostic features for MPC progression, being detectable by bulk WGS in virtually all MM and in 80% of\nprogressive patients, but absent among the stable ones. Despite its importance, it remains unclear whether\nAPOBEC mutagenesis represents a genuine driver that promotes genomic instability and mutations in driver\ngenes, or if it is merely an epiphenomenon of genomic instability and transformation. Considering that MM\nevolution is spread across decades, it is impossible to define when APOBEC starts its aberrant mutational activity\nduring MM and MPC pathogenesis. To overcome this limitation, our group has interrogated the genomic\nlandscape of the immunocompetent Vk*MYC mouse model known to spontaneously develop MM over 12-18\nmonths. Spontaneous APOBEC mutational activity was detected in ~50% of the mice, making the Vk*MYC\nmouse the first immunocompetent model of cancer where it is possible to investigate the spontaneous APOBEC\nmutational activation. Exploring longitudinally with scWGS DLP+ the progressive expansion of clonal plasma\ncells in the Vk*MYC mouse model and combining the Vk*MYC mouse with mouse models with constitutive and\ninducible APOBEC activity will allow to define the role of APOBEC activation in MPC progression into MM.", "project_title": "Myeloma Defining Genomic Events to Differentiate Benign and Malignant Myeloma Precursor Conditions", "phr_text": "NARRATIVE\nMyeloma precursor conditions are detectable in 3-5% of the adult population, and the identification of the small\nfraction of patients that will progress into multiple myeloma represents one of the most important unmet clinical\nneeds.

various polymorphisms associated with AMD, there still is\nno clear picture of the mechanisms leading to disease initiation and progression. The main\npathological hallmark of AMD is the accumulation of lipid-rich deposits, namely drusen,\nbetween the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) and the choroid, leading to retina degeneration.\nSeveral risk variants for AMD occur in lipid-related genes, including the apolipoprotein E\n(APOE) gene, but their role in AMD is unknown. We hypothesize that differences in lipid\ntransport between APOE variants contribute to or inhibit AMD phenotypes. Unfortunately, there\nare currently no model systems for a rigorous assessment of the interplay between genetic factors\nand AMD pathology. Using induced pluripotent stem cell technology we developed an in vitro\nhuman outer blood-retina barrier (oBRB) that includes RPE and a choriocapillaris-like\ncompartment and spontaneously forms sub-RPE deposits. Here, we propose to leverage these\ntechnologies and generate genetically modifiable retina tissue to investigate interactions between\nAMD phenotypes, lipid metabolism and APOE variants. In Aim 1, we will optimize the oBRB to\nstudy AMD phenotypes in a robust system that can also be assembled from cryopreserved cells.\nWe will manipulate intrinsic and extrinsic factors to induce drusen in this system and correlate\nwith human postmortem eyes. Next, we will generate isogenic oBRBs with different APOE\nvariants to determine the mechanisms by which the APOE genotype influences AMD pathology\nby comparing their transcriptomic, lipidomic and functional profiles. Since the contribution of\nchoriocapillaris hypoperfusion and function to the initiation of AMD is not well understood, in\nAim 2, we will integrate microvascular perfusion into our system to investigate how genetically\ndriven abnormalities affect AMD phenotypes. We will optimize a microfluidic approach with\nmicrovascular perfusion, generating a perfused oBRB (poBRB). Next, we will use a panel of live\nassays to investigate the contribution of APOE variants to poBRB vascular phenotypes and\ncorrelate that with the spatial distribution of drusen-like deposits. Collectively, we will unravel\nhow APOE variants contribute to drusen formation, RPE and microvascular dysfunctional\nphenotypes and pinpoint cellular subtypes responsible for APOE effect. We will also determine\nthe contribution of specific types of lipids to drusen formation. This work will establish a\nmultimodal retina modeling approach to study AMD phenotypes. We anticipate that our work\nwill reveal AMD therapeutic targets associated to lipid metabolism.", "project_title": "Reconstruction of a human blood-retina barrier and perfused vascular system to investigate the role of APOE variants in age-related macular degeneration", "phr_text": "Project Narrative\nAge-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss after 50 years of age,\nwith an estimated global prevalence of 288 million by 2040.

and pneumonia. A subset of immune cells, Foxp3+ regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs),\nare essential in resolving inflammation for several experimental models of acute lung injury (ALI). Furthermore,\nseveral groups, including ours, have established that Tregs are present in the lungs of patients with ARDS,\nsuggesting Tregs contribute to recovery during ARDS. While therapies are limited for ARDS, several trials have\nillustrated the mortality benefits of glucocorticoid (GC) therapy for ARDS and pneumonia. The mechanistic\neffects of GC are pleiotropic, and their influences on Treg phenotype and function are varied and remain ill-\ndefined during ARDS. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of patient responses to GC and the contribution of the\netiology and severity of the illnesses, the timing of therapy, and the dosage of GC to GC's efficacy all merit more\ninvestigation. Our published studies in murine ALI demonstrate that during the resolving phase of lung injury,\nTregs expand in number and change their gene expression profiles compared to Tregs in uninjured control lungs.\nTreg transcriptome profiles suggest changes in gene expression that may contribute to Treg-driven lung repair.\nOne transcript upregulated in Tregs isolated from resolving lung tissue is the glucocorticoid receptor (GR)\n(Nr3c1). Our Aims seek to test the hypothesis that glucocorticoid signaling occurs through Tregs, and this Treg-\nsignaling is critical to GC effects. Aim 1 proposes to determine the function of Treg\u2019s GR signaling and the direct\nand indirect impact of GCs on Treg-promoted resolution. We hypothesize that the administration of exogenous\nGC affects Treg responses during resolution. Additionally, we will test the hypothesis that GR-deficient Tregs\nhave decreased immunomodulatory and tissue reparative effects during ALI. Aim 2 addresses the effects of host\ngenetic variations on the functions of Tregs and the effects of GCs. Host genetic variation likely impacts on the\nimmunologic response during ARDS and are determinants of outcomes. The Collaborative Cross (CC) is a multi-\nparental genetic reference population generated using eight founder mouse strains. These genetically diverse\nCC strains demonstrate phenotypic variability useful for genetic mapping disease trait-associated quantitative\ntrait loci (QTL). Variation in Treg phenotypes in the CC has been reported. Aim 2 proposes leveraging the CC's\ngenetic diversity to test the hypotheses that 1) host genetic variation impacts the response to exogenous GC\nadministration after inducing ALI and 2) variation in the Treg number or effector phenotypes across the CC\nassociates with different rates of resolution of ALI and identifies genetic loci that define genes of host variation.\nWe predict that the proposed studies will identify genetic loci that modulate Treg responses critical in resolving\nALI and will identify the role of GCs in promoting resolution. Identifying and elucidating these mechanisms of GC\naction and GR function may identify possible therapeutic approaches to lessen collateral tissue damage without\nnegatively altering the response to injury.", "project_title": "The effect of endogenous and exogenous glucocorticoids acting through regulatory T cells on resolution of ALI and the contribution of host genetic variability.", "phr_text": "Project Narrative\n Our research addresses critical questions regarding the recovery of lung structure and function following\nacute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pneumonia, and the specific immune cell types and their\nfunctions in lung recovery.

Unfortunately, the efficacy of these therapies is impeded by limited\nprogression-free survival rates, partial response, and the development of resistance. While combination\ntherapies involving both sotorasib and adagrasib are being explored to enhance treatment outcomes, the\ninherent challenge of heightened toxicity when employing multiple agents in the clinical setting persists.\n We aim to address this challenge through a novel targeted approach for K-Ras(G12C) mutation-driven\ncancers, designed to intrinsically act on multiple pathways concurrently through a single but multi-functional\nprodrug, conceptually a targeted unimolecular combination therapy. These prodrug molecules are derivatives of\ncytotoxic natural products that transfer molecular fragments to K-Ras(G12C). This phenomenon, known as group\ntransfer, results in the covalent labeling of cysteine 12 in K-Ras(G12C). We posit that the group transfer of E3\nligase recruiting fragments could engender the targeted degradation of K-Ras(G12C). The therapeutic impact is\nenhanced by liberating the cytotoxic jerantinine alkaloids inherent in our prodrugs, which in themselves target\nmultiple pathways (polypharmaceuticals).\nThe ultimate goal is to demonstrate selective group transfer within the complex cellular milieu and the\nsynergistic effects of targeted protein degradation coupled with the release of cytotoxic polypharmaceuticals.\nAim 1: Determine the binding location of jerantinine alkaloids to K-Ras(G12C) and the selectivity of\njerantinine alkaloid-mediated group transfer to K-Ras(G12C). Following the synthesis of a library of hybrid\nligands, designed to interrogate the effect of electrophile type and steric bulk on group transfer, we will test these\ncompounds for covalent labeling of K-Ras(G12C), and selectivity for K-Ras(G12C) using Whole Protein Mass\nSpectrometry (MS). LC/MS-MS-based assays will be used to evaluate covalent labeling of K-Ras(G12C) in cells.\nOnce compounds demonstrating covalent labeling of K-Ras in cells are identified, we will employ activity-based\nprotein profiling (ABPP) to evaluate their selectivity towards a specific subset of cysteines within the proteome.\nAim 2: Determine if jerantinine alkaloid mediated group transfer leads to K-Ras degradation and identify\nany synergistic effects of targeted degradation and concomitant release of cytotoxic natural product.\nHybrid molecules containing E3 ligase recruiting functionality will be synthesized. Covalent modification of K-\nRas(G12C) by these molecules and selectivity will be confirmed using the methods outlined in Aim 1. K-\nRas(G12C) degradation will be evaluated using western blot, and the efficacy and synergistic effects of\ndegradation and polypharmaceutical release will be determined by screening against suitable 2D cell lines.

The majority of drug overdoses involve opioids, and opioid-involved stimulant deaths are rising\nwith 3 out of every 4 cocaine-related deaths involving opioids and 53% of psychostimulant-related deaths\ninvolving opioids7. Drug overdose mortality among Veterans mirror these trends5,6. In Massachusetts, among\nindividuals who died of an opioid overdose, 1 in 6 had a non-fatal overdose in the preceding 12 months17.\nThese non-fatal overdoses serve as a promising target for opioid overdose prevention efforts, especially for\nevidence-based treatments such as medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). The increase in stimulant-\ninvolved opioid overdoses also highlights the need to investigate strategies to improve uptake of evidence-\nbased treatments for stimulant use disorders.\nSignificance: In March 2019, the VHA Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention released a national\nclinical note template, the Suicide Behavior and Overdose Report (SBOR). The SBOR standardizes the\nreporting process, enhances the visibility of suicide and overdose events in the medical record, and is intended\nto improve clinical care after these events (e.g., by incorporating risk factors for overdose and strategies to\nmitigate risk, including referrals for care). However, the SBOR is currently mandated for intentional overdose\nand only recommended for unintentional overdose. Moreover, it is unclear the extent to which it is being used\nand whether its use improves post-overdose care as intended.\nInnovation and Impact: The proposed study will characterize non-fatal opioid-, stimulant-, and combined\nopioid and stimulant overdoses among VHA patients and the extent to which they receive recommended post-\noverdose care. Given that the SBOR will soon be mandated for all overdoses, and to ensure that VHA is doing\neverything it can to prevent overdose mortality among Veterans, it is critical to understand whether the SBOR\nis improving post-overdose care as intended and if additional strategies may be needed.\nSpecific Aims: The proposed study will pursue the following specific aims:\nAim 1: Characterize non-fatal opioid and/or stimulant overdoses within VHA and patient-, prescriber-, and\nsetting-related factors associated with post-overdose treatment utilization.\nAim 2: Describe utilization of the SBOR among providers of patients with non-fatal opioid and/or stimulant\noverdoses and associations between SBOR use, post-overdose treatment utilization, and treatment outcomes.\nAim 3: Identify barriers and facilitators of post-overdose care and ways to improve it via interviews with VHA\npatients, patients\u2019 concerned others, and treatment providers.\nMethodology: The Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance\u2014RE-AIM\u2014framework\nwill guide our study. Aim 1: VHA patients with non-fatal overdoses will be identified using Corporate Data\nWarehouse (CDW), Community Care, and Medicare data from Fiscal Years 2014 to 2021 (FY2014-2021).\nRegression models will describe patient, prescriber, and setting factors associated with post-overdose care.\nAim 2: Using CDW, Community Care, and Medicare data combined with VA Mortality Data Repository data,\nprimary analyses will examine whether providers\u2019 SBOR use is associated with patients\u2019 post-overdose\ntreatment utilization and reduced mortality using marginal structural Cox mediational models. Aim 3: Up to 60\ntotal interviews will be conducted with VHA patients who experienced a non-fatal overdose, their concerned\nothers, and VHA providers who documented a non-fatal overdose. Rapid and in-depth qualitative analytic\napproaches will be used; the former allows for rapid provision of actionable feedback to operations partners.\nNext Steps/Implementation: Our research team has strong operational partnerships and helped develop and\nimplement the SBOR. Our team will ensure that findings are quickly translated to improve post-overdose care.", "project_title": "Strategies to improve Utilization of Post-overdose Evidence-based Risk mitigation among Non-fatal Overdoses in VA (SUPER NOVA)", "phr_text": "Drug overdose is the leading cause of accidental death in the United States. While opioid overdoses comprise\nmost overdose deaths, stimulant overdose deaths are rising. This project examines an important but missed\nopportunity\u2014non-fatal overdose\u2014to improve Veterans\u2019 health care and health outcomes. To improve post-\noverdose care, the Veterans Health Administration developed a national clinical note template\u2014the Suicide\nBehavior and Overdose Report (SBOR)\u2014which is currently recommended for unintentional overdoses\n(majority of overdoses) but will soon be mandated. However, the SBOR is currently optimized to address\nopioid, not stimulant, overdose. Also, despite the promise of the SBOR to improve post-overdose care,\nunknown is the extent to which clinicians are using it and whether its use improves post-overdose care as\nintended. This project will fill a great need to understand how to improve the SBOR and, ultimately, post-\noverdose treatment for Veterans who have non-fatal overdoses and remain at high risk for poor

anesthetics via an implanted intrathecal drug\ndelivery system have profound efficacy in some of the most severe high impact chronic pain conditions. Despite\ntheir profound efficacy, their use is limited primarily because of side effects such as tolerance, psychosis and\nmotor block associated with drugs used in them (opioids, ziconotide, local anesthetics). Novel analgesics that\ntake advantage of spinal pain processing, are safe to use in humans and have minimal motor block and tolerance\ncan be revolutionary in the management of high impact chronic pain conditions.\nContulakin-G (CGX) is a snail venom derived peptide that has homology with mammalian neurotensin has been\nshown to be safe in humans and in a small, pilot Phase1A study demonstrated analgesic effects in patients with\nspinal cord injury pain, a high impact chronic pain condition. These studies suggested a possibility of a novel,\nnon-opioid, analgesic mechanism that is active in humans. Our preliminary studies in animal models of high\nimpact chronic pain unraveled spinal neurotensin receptor 2 (NTSR2) and subsequent inhibition of voltage-gated\ncalcium channels Cav2.3 and 2.2 as an opioid-independent spinal analgesic mechanism. Importantly, despite\nprofound analgesia, NTSR2 activation was not associated with unwarranted side effects such as rapid tolerance\nor motor blockade.\nDespite clear translational relevance of NTSR2-Cav2.3/2.2 pathway, nothing is known about NTSR2\ndownstream signaling that leads to calcium channel inhibition, particularly so in sensory neurons. Aim 1 will\nevaluate detailed signaling following NTSR2 activation that leads to calcium channel inhibition in mouse sensory\nneurons. Aim 2 will assess the anatomical correlation and functional significance of NTSR2-Cav pathway in\nhuman sensory neurons and spinal cord. Aim 3 will evaluate in vivo significance of this pathway in models of\nhigh impact chronic pain with rigorous independent replication.\nIf successful, proposed studies could unravel the signaling molecules involved in human-tested mechanism for\nthe treatment of high impact chronic pain conditions. Moreover, this information can be utilized for further\ndevelopment of novel analgesics that are biased agonist of or directly engage this signaling pathway.", "project_title": "Dissection of NTSR2/calcium channel signaling as a non-opioid spinal analgesic mechanism for the treatment of high impact chronic pain", "phr_text": "Project Narrative:\nSpinal analgesics have profound efficacy in high impact chronic pain conditions as they directly target the spinal\ndorsal horn, a critical center in the pain processing.

"abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nSyndecans are transmembrane cell surface proteoglycans that bind to cytokines and growth factors, and assist\nin the formation of scaffolds that support signaling of other cell surface receptors. Importantly, syndecan-1\n(SDC1) is implicated in the control of IL-17A signaling. Transmembrane SDC1 (tmSDC1) is cleaved from the cell\nsurface to generate soluble bioactive molecules that can become PAMPs/DAMPs, function as decoy receptors,\nand create chemokine gradients that augment inflammation. tmSDC1 is highly expressed on airway epithelial\ncells and its loss occurs concomitantly with E-cadherin and is considered a sign of epithelial-to-mesenchymal\ntransition (EMT) and impaired airway epithelial barrier function. Soluble SDC1 is a biomarker in numerous\nfibrotic, oncogenic, and inflammatory diseases. tmSDC1 cleavage is caused predominantly by the enzyme\nheparanase (Hpse), which is secreted by inflammatory myeloid cells and lymphocytes. Specific Hpse inhibitors\nare being studied in early-phase clinical trials. We and others have reported on the anti-inflammatory effects of\ncapsaicin, the active compound found in chili peppers and a potent TRPV1 agonist, which can inhibit IL-6 and\nTNF\u03b1 secretion from macrophages, and can also inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation to suppress IL-1\u03b2\nsecretion. Our lab has established a model of mixed-granulocytic, T2/T17, steroid-resistant severe allergic\nasthma, which has revealed the key role of IL-17A in driving airway neutrophilia and glucocorticoid resistance,\nwhile also establishing the importance of IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 in the development of T17 disease. sSDC1 levels are\naugmented in this severe allergic asthma model and capsaicin treatment reduces the release of sSDC1 from\nairway epithelial club cells. We hypothesize that cleavage of airway epithelial syndecan-1 (SDC1) by leukocyte-\nderived heparanases augments inflammation, barrier dysfunction, and steroid resistance in a mixed-granulocytic\nmodel of severe allergic asthma, and that this activity and its pathological consequences are inhibited by\ncapsaicin. In SA1, we will evaluate the consequences of HDM-induced heparanase activity from mouse\nmacrophages on mouse airway epithelial cell SDC1 cleavage. We will determine whether this upregulation of\ngene expression translates into increased enzyme activity, whether these effects can be abrogated by capsaicin\nin vitro, and whether macrophage Hpse activity induces airway epithelial cell tmSDC1 shedding.

Loss- and\ngain-of-function SPI1 gene mutations were recently described as causes of agammaglobulinemia and\nWaldenstr\u00f6m macroglobulinemia. Preliminary data indicates other changes in SPI1 activity/dose may cause\nadditional clinical phenotypes including common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) and autoimmune\ndiseases. The long-range goal of the proposed work is to determine SPI1\u2019s full role in human health and\ndisease(s). Our objective is to establish mechanisms of SPI1 gene regulation in human germinal center B\ncells and the consequences of dysregulation. The working hypothesis is that SPI1 has a critical role\nthroughout B cell development, including germinal center (GC) B cell maturation, and that the culmination of\nrare SPI1 coding mutations and common non-coding variants determine disease state. To explore this\nhypothesis, we propose the following aims: 1) Identify non-coding elements regulating SPI1 gene\nexpression in human GC B cells 2) Delineate effects of coding variants in SPI1 on autoregulation and\nexpression 3) Determine maturational and transcriptional consequences SPI1 LOF and SPI1 GOF\nmutations to differentiated B cells. The contribution is significant because SPI1\u2019s role in human GC\nresponses is unexplored but is clearly affected in several patient groups carrying SPI1 gene mutations. The\nproposed work is innovative because we are using only human and human derived cells, including bona\nfide tonsillar GC B cells for proposed experiments. We are comprehensively investigating the role of coding\nand non-coding DNA on SPI1 regulation using crystallography, NMR, long-read sequencing, prime editors,\nbase editors, ATAC-, RNA- and ChIP-seq. Finally we are utilizing tonsillar organoids to model the effects of\naltered SPI1 dose on GC B cell maturation in human lymphoid follicles.", "project_title": "Genetic determinates of SPI1 expression and activity in human germinal center B cells", "phr_text": "PROJECT NARRITIVE:\nHuman B cells are exquisitely sensitive to changes in the transcription factor SPI1.

Despite being the focus of extensive genetic and biochemical efforts, the mechanism of ESX-\nmediated protein secretion, especially through the cell wall, remains elusive. In general, the exploration of\nsecretion pathways within the cell wall of mycobacteria is constrained by the current limited ability to localize\nproteins to specific subcellular compartments. The objective of this exploration is to overcome this obstacle\ntowards elucidating protein secretion by the ESX-1 system. The rationale is that the tools and the knowledge\ngained will allow us to (1) track components of the ESX-1 system to the cell wall and/or cell surface and (2)\nthereby test a model for ESX-mediated secretion through the cell envelope by establishing the hierarchy of\nexport to these subcellular compartments. The innovation of this proposal is to apply cell wall-specific protein\ntagging, surface-specific protein detection, and site-specific protein photocrosslinking methods that have not\nyet been applied to ESX-1-mediated secretion. Prior research, including initial studies, provide evidence that\nthese approaches will be successful in achieving the stated goals. The proposed studies are expected to\nestablish functional and molecular relationships among ESX-1 substrates that determine their transit through\nthe cell envelope and thereby enable future studies into the detailed mechanism of ESX-1 secretion.

Our RISE doctoral trainees have, on average, completed their PhD at higher\nrates and in less time than the average of PhD students in these doctoral programs. Furthermore, the\napplication pools through which PhD students come to pursue their thesis work at Hunter is remarkably\ndiverse. Individuals from underrepresented (UR) minority groups represent 29.3% of the PhD students\nmatriculating in the five participating doctoral programs over the past five years. This robust pipeline of IMSD-\neligible matriculants will enable the proposed program to effectively contribute to increasing diversity in the\nbiomedical research workforce. The proposed IMSD program will build on our strengths to further improve the\nskill sets and outcomes of our trainees across 3 domains: science communication, big data analytics,\nand holistic career development. These skill sets are crucial to develop and enhance in the early years of\ndoctoral training (years 2-4) as we propose. Program activities will enable trainees to develop 1) resiliency in\nscience, 2) time management strategies, 3) enhanced critical thinking, and 4) effective mentor/mentee\nrelationships. Additionally, Fellows will engage in teaching undergraduate labs and courses to develop their\nscience communication and leadership skills, including academic and professional confidence. Program\nactivities will also focus on developing skills in grantsmanship, large data set analyses, and oral\npresentations. All program activities will assist our students to 1) Attain PhD program landmarks/milestones in\na timely manner, 2) Develop skills in critical thinking, writing, and science communication; 3) Gain additional\ntraining in technological skills that support their research and career interest; and 4) develop skills in leadership\nthat support conducting ethically responsible and rigorous science investigation. The Fellows will also benefit\nfrom the experience of their mentors. The 35 participating faculty were recruited for their funding, productivity,\nand success in student development/mentorship, as well as their active engagement in their Doctoral\nPrograms (including service on admissions and recruitment committees). Our Fellows will also have the strong\ninstitutional support of both Hunter College and the CUNY Graduate Center (the administrative hub for\ngraduate studies at CUNY). Both institutions have a long-standing commitment to supporting the development\nof UR students in the sciences and, thus, a keen interest in supporting this proposed new IMSD program.

cardiovascular disease, poor quality of life, and death. The most severe forms of AKI cause\nparenchymal damage, which manifests as a persistent loss of kidney function. This condition, termed intrinsic\nAKI (iAKI), carries the highest mortality and risk for long-term loss of kidney function. Due to their older age\nand high prevalence of risk factors, Veterans are at especially high risk for experiencing iAKI compared to the\ngeneral population. Despite decades of investment, no successful treatments have been translated from\npreclinical studies into routine clinical practice. The latter has led to calls for greater understanding of the\nmechanisms responsible for defining risk in human iAKI.\n A growing area of investigation is understanding the genetic basis for susceptibility to iAKI. Early studies\nhave been limited by small sample sizes, a lack of unbiased approaches (e.g. genome wide association\n(GWA)) and predicted gene expression studies, and most importantly, superficial phenotyping that does not\ndistinguish between causes of AKI. As iAKI is a heterogeneous condition, this critical deficiency can dilute\nbiological signals and treatment effects in large-scale studies. Lastly, few studies in AKI have explored\nidentifying novel phenotypes, or endophenotypes of iAKI, which have shown promise for improving\nunderstanding of other complex and heterogeneous conditions. The overarching goals of this proposal are to\na) advance the clinical phenotyping of the most common and severe forms of intrinsic AKI (iAKI), and b)\nleverage these phenotypes to identify genetic variants associated with iAKI.\n In Aim 1, we will apply a data-driven deep learning algorithm to dense structured data and narrative text to\ndiscover data patterns that will likely represent a mixture of previously recognized and unrecognized\nendophenotypes of AKI. In Aim 2, we will complement this strategy by generating probabilistic phenotype\nalgorithms that use manual chart review to identify traditional iAKI phenotypes in 3 clinical settings where iAKI\nis common: cardiovascular surgery, cardiac catheterization, and sepsis. In Aim 3, we will perform a series of\nGWA studies within these settings comparing cases identified by our iAKI phenotyping algorithms in Aim 2 to\npatients without AKI within the Million Veteran Program. We will also conduct the same analyses using the\nmost promising Aim 1 data-driven endophenotypes. We will evaluate the top associated regions using\nPrediXcan to examine predicted gene expression in kidney tissues.\n The proposed studies will be performed within the VA Million Veterans Gamma Program by a\nmultidisciplinary team of experts in AKI phenotyping, informatics-based phenotype developers, and genetic\nepidemiologists. The deliverables from this proposal will advance the computational phenotyping of iAKI,\nexpand the rigor and scale of large-scale genotype-phenotype studies in iAKI, and provide important\ninformation regarding clinical iAKI disease mechanisms.", "project_title": "Advancing the Phenotyping of Acute Kidney Injury for the Million Veterans Program", "phr_text": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a complex and deadly disease.

Heart failure (HF) represents a major health burden, with 80% of the HF health care costs\nattributable to hospitalizations. Reducing HF readmissions is a major VA strategic goal. Our pilot study\ndemonstrated that multivariate physiological telemetry using a small wearable sensor has a high\ncompliance rate and provides accurate early detection of impending readmission for HF exacerbation.\nWe now propose to implement non-invasive remote monitoring at 5 VA medical centers.\nSignificance/Impact Despite treatment advances, hospitalizations for HF exacerbation remain\nprevalent and costly. Accurate and timely detection of incipient HF exacerbation may be one path to\nreducing HF readmissions.\nInnovation The study will develop an implementation strategy for noninvasive remote monitoring with\npredictive analytics and an algorithmic treatment response to clinical alerts coming from the analytical\nplatform. The result will be a reliable link between the clinical alert and an intervention that can affect\nthe clinical outcome of the patient. Algorithmic response to the device alert will be a subject of ongoing\nvalidation and update as part of the learning health-care system concept. This will allow for integration\nwith the electronic health record, optimization and standardization of the response process and\ndecrease alert fatigue. Furthermore, we will evaluate patient and provider attitudes toward using remote\nmonitoring to guide HF therapy, as well as the impact of this approach on key clinical outcomes.\nSpecific Aims Aim 1. Implement remote monitoring into the clinical workflow of HF care.\nAim 1a. Design implementation strategies for non-invasive remote monitoring and algorithmic\nresponse to clinical alerts generated by the predictive analytics platform.\nAim 1b. Evaluate implementation outcomes, including clinician and patient perceptions and adoption\nof the use of ambulatory remote monitoring data.\nAim 2. Conduct a feasibility study of non-invasive remote monitoring in chronic HF.\nAim 2a. Define key characteristics that will inform design of a pivotal trial of non-invasive remote\nmonitoring aimed at reducing rehospitalization and improving quality of life in HF.\nAim 2b. Identify costs associated with implementation and non-invasive remote monitoring in HF.\nMethodology We will design implementation processes using the i-PARiHS framework and three\nimplementation phases: 1) implementation intervention planning; 2) formative evaluation of pilot\nimplementation at 2 vanguard sites; and 3) Implementation fidelity monitoring. We will enroll 240\npatients hospitalized for HF exacerbation at 5 participating VA centers. All study subjects will receive\nthe monitoring kit, which will be used for 90 days after discharge. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to\nan intervention arm, where clinicians will be notified of clinical alerts and will follow response algorithm\nto modify HF treatment or recommend urgent clinic visit/emergency room visit, and to the control arm,\nwhere information from the sensors will be collected, but clinical alerts will not be generated or\ncommunicated to providers. Study outcomes will include the proportion of randomized patients who\nmeet the algorithm\u2019s criteria for at least one alert, the proportion of time the remote monitor is in use\nand functioning properly, HF hospitalization rate, hospital stay length, and health-related quality of life.\nNext Steps This work will inform design of a pivotal trial of non-invasive remote monitoring aimed at\nreducing rehospitalization and improving quality of life in HF. Implementation strategies developed in\nthis study may be used not only for implementation of the monitoring approach tested, but also for other\nremote monitoring strategies in HF and additional chronic health conditions.", "project_title": "Continuous Wearable Monitoring Analytics to Improve Outcomes in Heart Failure - LINK-HF2 multicenter implementation study", "phr_text": "Heart failure (HF) is present in 5% of veterans, represents a major health and economic burden, with 80% of\ncare costs attributable to hospitalizations.

in children\nand young adults with cancer predisposition syndromes. Spinal ependymoma (SP-EPN) is a molecularly distinct\ntumor that arises predominantly in the upper spinal cord. Most SP-EPN have biallelic genetic perturbations\naffecting the NF2 gene, and patients with NF2-associated schwannomatosis are predisposed to SP-EPN\ndevelopment. There is currently no effective medical therapy for SP-EPN. Surgical resection of late-stage\nsymptomatic lesions is associated with high morbidity and mortality. There is a critical need to identify the\nmolecular mechanisms underpinning pre-neoplastic lesions to halt progression in NF2 patients at an early stage.\nIn our preliminary studies, we leveraged a unique spinal neuroepithelial stem (NES) cell model to show failure\nof differentiation at the radial-glia cell stage in NF2 knockout (NF2-/-) NES cells and the formation of pre-\nneoplastic growths in vitro and in vivo. Further, although most of the SP-EPN tumor display ependymal cell\nsignatures, we identify a rare population within the tumor with radial-glia stem cell markers. The specific\nobjectives of this study are: (i) to identify the cellular hierarchy in NF2-/- NES cell derived preneoplastic cells\nand patient-derived SP-EPN; (ii) to define the dysregulated signaling pathways in NF2-/- NES cells that fail to\ndifferentiate and (iii) to identify activated kinase targets that may rescue this differentiation failure. We\nhypothesize that derailed radial glia cells in the developing spinal cord are the source of SP-EPN formation and\nthat targeting the aberrant signaling pathways in these cells will be important to prevent growth. To test this\nhypothesis, we will perform single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA seq) of NF2-/- NES cells during in vitro\ndifferentiation and xenografts (Aim 1). We will compare the molecular signatures of cells in pre-neoplastic\ngrowths with that of patient samples to validate the target pre-neoplastic cells in SP-EPN development. We will\nperform bulkRNA seq and multiplexed kinase inhibitor bead affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry\n(MiB/MS) to define the activated kinome profile of these pre-neoplastic cells compared to patient SP-EPN (Aim\n2a) and the key signaling pathways that are disrupted in these cells. In Aim 2b we will test candidate kinase\ninhibitors to test in our NF2-/- NES cell model to determine if the failure of differentiation can be rescued\npharmacologically. We expect to identify the cellular identity of NF2-/- preneoplastic cells that fail to differentiate,\nand the dysregulated signaling pathways that may be governing these cells. We aim to identify novel, rational\ntherapeutic targets to stop the progression of tumor formation in children with NF2. To achieve research\nindependence, I have identified three key areas in which I need mentorship and additional experience: (1)\nadvanced cell engineering; (2) single cell analytics; (3) kinome profiling for drug discovery. I will accomplish this\nwork under the mentorship of Dr Wade Clapp, a world expert in neurofibromatosis. Ultimately, I want to become\nan RO1 funded independent investigator directing a research program in brain and spinal cord tumorigenesis.", "project_title": "INVESTIGATING THE MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF DIFFERENTIATION FAILURE IN NF2 MUTANT NEUROEPITHELIAL STEM CELLS", "phr_text": "Project Narrative\nThe only treatment for late-stage symptomatic ependymoma is high-risk surgery.

Our overarching hypothesis is that miR-137 drives both neuronal and metabolic dysfunction, and that metabolic dysfunction contributes to disease susceptibility/progression.  Drosophila has served as a powerful genetic model system for studying both neuronal signaling as well as obesity and diabetes because organs, signaling pathways and proteins, as well as neuronal ion channels/receptors are highly conserved across species, and many disease-associated genes are conserved between Drosophila and humans.  Using Drosophila as an experimental system, we have found that miR-137 regulates both metabolic and neuronal function.

mechanisms that lead to their\ninitiation. Parasitic worms and allergens all trigger a \u201ctype 2\u201d immune response, but how these agonists are first\ndetected remains poorly understood. Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) are activated early in a type 2\nimmunity and coordinate downstream inflammation, but they do not directly sense worms or allergens. Instead,\nILC2s are activated by signals released from their surrounding tissue, such as the cytokine interleukin(IL)-33.\nIL-33 is critical for airway type 2 immunity and its release has been linked to cell lysis caused by helminths and\nmany allergens. We have discovered that leukotriene C4 (LTC4) and its metabolite LTD4 are also universally\nrequired for ILC2 activation and innate type 2 immunity in the lung. Which cells synthesize LTC4 and how this\nis activated by helminths or allergens remains unknown. Here we test the central hypothesis that by\ncoordinating the release of both IL-33 and LTC4, loss of plasma membrane integrity (LPMI) serves as a\nunifying mechanism for the induction of type 2 immunity. First, we identify alveolar macrophages as an\nimportant source of LTC4 and study how LTC4 synthesis is regulated in these cells. Next, we examine the\nunique contributions of LTC4 and LTD4 to acute and long-term ILC2 function and downstream type 2 immunity.\nLastly, we use novel tools to examine the link between lytic cell death and type 2 immunity in the lung. Our\nwork promises to uncover novel mechanisms regulating induction of type 2 immunity and will therefore suggest\nnovel therapeutic approaches to treat or prevent diseases such as asthma.", "project_title": "Cell lysis-induced leukotriene synthesis activates type-2 immunity in the lung", "phr_text": "Project Narrative\nParasitic worms and allergens all trigger a type 2 immune response, but it remains unclear how they are\ninitially detected by the immune system.

Older adults\nhave experienced significant increases in OUD or OD in the last decade despite a decrease in the number of\nopioid prescriptions, signaling an urgent need to identify factors beyond prescription opioid use that contribute\nto OUD/OD to inform interventions in older populations. Pain, multimorbidity, and polypharmacy, all strongly\nassociated with advancing age, are frequently noted as potential risk factors for OUD/OD in older adults, but\nrelevant evidence is lacking.

insufficiency (POI) is the most extreme form of infertility with loss of oocytes before the age of\n40 years. We have made significant progress understanding the genetics of POI, with a candidate gene\nidentified in 23-30% of women with POI after whole exome sequencing (WES). We demonstrated\napproximately 50% of gene variants are found in genes critical for DNA damage and repair and\ntranscription/translation fidelity. These gene families are also implicated in cancer risk. Using genealogy\ninformation from the Utah Population Database (UPDB), we demonstrated that women with POI have\nincreased relative risk for breast cancer, while their first-, second- and third-degree relatives have increased\nrisk for breast, colon, and prostate cancer. We will use three generation families and additional validated cases\nof POI, gene identification decision support tools and functional models, along with replication cohorts to\nexpand our studies for an in-depth examination of the relationship between POI and cancer risk. We will add\nclinical and basic science cancer and computational investigators and new artificial intelligence and genetic\napproaches to understand cancer risk in POI. Specific Aim 1 will identify additional cancer risk tracking with\nPOI in affected women and their families using the UPDB and unique cancer clustering algorithms. Specific\nAim 2 will identify genetic mutations in women with familial cancer risk through whole genome sequencing. We\nwill use novel software (GEM) developed at the University of Utah to prioritize variants in familial POI and\ncancer. We will also examine de novo mutation rate as an additional mechanism for cancer risk in these\nwomen. Variants will be replicated in data from large biobanks and functionally assessed in our D.\nmelanogaster functional model and a new DNA damage cell-based assay. Specific Aim 3 will combine\ngenetic and demographic data from the UPDB with clinical data from the electronic medical record (EMR) in\nwomen with POI to create a cancer prediction and assessment tool. The portability of the tool will be tested in\nan outside health system. The work addresses fertility as a marker of overall health by examining the cause of\nincreased cancer in diseases associated with decreased ovarian reserve, particularly in women with POI. Early\nidentification of risk associated with a POI diagnosis will inform our recommendations for careful medical follow\nup and hormone replacement therapy in at-risk women.", "project_title": "Comorbid Disease in Women with Primary Ovarian Insufficiency", "phr_text": "Narrative\nThe proposal will determine whether the etiology of increased cancer risk in women with primary ovarian\ninsufficiency (POI) and their family members has a shared genetic cause with POI or results from an increased\nmutation rate.

research program investigating the\ninfluence of nicotine withdrawal on oxygen sensing. The research and career development plans have been\ncarefully designed to provide the necessary skills for Dr. Wollman to establish a novel, independent line of\nresearch and include the following objectives: 1) to gain further expertise in research methodology and\ntechniques, 2) develop teaching and mentoring skills, and 3) to develop grant writing skills and further academic\nleadership skills. ENVIRONMENT: Primary mentor Dr. Fregosi is an expert in studying breathing both in vivo\nand in vitro and will provide technical guidance for Aim 1 experiments during the K99 phase. Mentors Dr.\nPrabhakar is an expert in carotid sinus nerve recordings and patch clamp from carotid body glomus cells, and\nDr. Oweiss is an expert in vivo gCaMP imaging, and will provide extensive training to Dr. Wollman during the\nK99 phase. Both mentors, along with the rest of the assembled advisory committee, will help to ensure Dr.\nWollman\u2019s success with this proposal. With the exception of hands on training with Drs. Prabhakar in Chicago\nand Oweiss in Florida, all of the work proposed here will be carried out in the Fregosi laboratory. Dr. Fregosi has\nNIH funding and the resources needed to support Dr. Wollman during the training phase of the research project.\nThe University of Arizona College of Medicine is an ideal setting for the mentored phase of this proposal due to\nthe outstanding faculty mentors and facilities available. RESEARCH: My overarching hypothesis is that nicotine\nwithdrawal alters the carotid body and neurons in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), key neural structures that\nare involved in oxygen sensing. Preliminary data shows that chronic nicotine exposure has no effect on the\nventilatory response to hypoxia, however rats show a blunted response to hypoxia after 48 hours of nicotine\nwithdrawal. To build on these novel preliminary data, I have designed the following specific aims. Aim 1: To\ntest the effects of nicotine withdrawal on the ventilatory response to 10, 12, or 15% hypoxia, and to test the ability\nfor an acute dose of nicotine to rescue this response. Aim 2: To test the effects of nicotine withdrawal on oxygen\nsensing in the carotid body, NTS neuron activation and the respiratory motor output from the phrenic nerve in\nvivo. Aim 3: To test the effects of nicotine withdrawal on nicotinic acetylcholine receptor function in carotid body\nglomus cells and NTS neurons in vitro. This work will be carried out using plethysmography, a unique\ncombination of in vivo calcium imaging using fiber photometry, and concurrent phrenic nerve recordings, and\nwhole cell patch clamp of glomus cells in excised carotid bodies and NTS neurons in a brainstem slice. The\nproposed training plan will allow Dr. Wollman to learn new experimental techniques, successfully complete the\nproposed research and transition to an independent, extramurally-funded tenure-track position at a top-tier (R1)\nresearch institution.", "project_title": "The Influence of Nicotine Withdrawal on Oxygen Sensing", "phr_text": "PROJECT NARRATIVE\nIn preliminary experiments I showed, for the first time, that adult rats in nicotine withdrawal have a markedly\nreduced ventilatory response to hypoxia. This has important clinical ramifications, as hypoxia is a commonly\nencountered medical complication, and withdrawal symptoms are often observed in hospitalized patients as it is\ncommon for them to abstain from smoking during periods of worsening health or in preparation for surgery. The\nfocus of this proposal is to learn and refine brand new skills that will allow me to unravel the mechanisms of this\nnovel phenomenon.", "spending_categories_desc": null, "agency_code": "NIH", "covid_response": null, "arra_funded": "N", "budget_start": "2025-02-03T12:02:00Z", "budget_end": "2026-01-31T12:01:00Z", "cfda_code": "838", "funding_mechanism": "Non-SBIR/STTR", "direct_cost_amt": 167114, "indirect_cost_amt": 81886, "project_detail_url": "https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/11251341", "date_added": "2025-02-08T04:02:52Z"}]}
